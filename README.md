# CloudCanal.js
<a href="https://www.cloudcanal.io" target="_blank">Cloud Canal</a> is a low-code framework for turning static websites into web apps. On its own, it doesn't provide a back end or a front end; instead, it serves as the glue that connects the two together. CC is platform agnostic, meaning that it can be used with systems that are written from scratch or developed in drag-and-drop builders. For example, you can easily connect a website built in <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> to a back end powered by <a href="https://bubble.io/" target="_blank">Bubble</a> or <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>.

Using Cloud Canal is simple:
<ol>
  <li>Register yourself and your domain(s) at <a href="https://www.cloudcanal.io" target="_blank">https://www.cloudcanal.io</a></li>
  <li>Set up a Connector that maps to an API you'd like to use</li>
  <li>Include this script (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/CloudCanal/CloudCanal@1/CloudCanal.min.js) after jQuery</li>
  <li>Add data-attributes to elements on your site</li>
</ol>
